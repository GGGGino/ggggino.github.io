  Once upon a time there is a fresh student waiting for his dream job...
</p>

I attended the ITC school Marchi specialization in IT and telecommunications. I was not very good at school except for math, English and programming, but I did it. History was my Achilles' heel.

The high school nauseated me with the study so I preferred to not go to the university, but instead I wanted to start working on what I did better... *programming*..

Started as web developer I was focused on building simple Websites for a Comunication agency in Lucca.

After some months I understand an important lesson...

> that the more I learned, the more I WANTED to learn and the more I HAVE to learn.

So I start to reintroduce myself to the world of Study, and I discovered many way to build a website.

Then I started to develop more sophisticated websites with some kind of technologies such as Drupal, Symfony..

* _2011_ - Pure [PHP](http://www.php.net/) websites, with jquery for animations and css for styling
* _2012_ - *Wordpress* :(, [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* _2013, 2014_ - [Symfony](https://symfony.com/), simple [REST](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) calls, [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [Sonata](https://sonata-project.org/)

In the years I always tried to archive new goals with always new technologies, this helped me a lot on having a general view on what/how I was doing.

So in late 2014 I changed company to find some new challenges. I didn't want to be a website builder for the rest of my life, I want to test myself with building **Web apps**.

I was only one year in the new company but there I build some cute things:

* A Js game developed with [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) that should represent a sort of [Puzzle bubble](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_Bobble)
* Build modules and themes for Drupal
* Frontend part of a important company
